# License Change Notice

**Date:** January 19, 2026  
**Effective Version:** 2.1.0

## Change Summary

BindSharp's license has been changed from **LGPL-3.0-or-later** to **MPL-2.0** (Mozilla Public License 2.0).

## Why the Change?

The MPL-2.0 is a more permissive copyleft license that:
- Allows easier integration with proprietary software
- Only requires sharing modifications to MPL-licensed files (file-level copyleft)
- Provides better patent protection
- Is more compatible with modern open-source ecosystems

## What This Means for Users

### If you're already using BindSharp:
- Versions before 2.1.0 remain under LGPL-3.0-or-later
- Upgrading to 2.1.0+ means accepting MPL-2.0 terms
- **Good news:** MPL-2.0 is generally *more permissive* than LGPL-3.0

### For new users:
- BindSharp 2.1.0+ is licensed under MPL-2.0
- You can use it in commercial/proprietary software
- You only need to share modifications to BindSharp's source files
- Your application code remains yours
